# HackDavis2022 - UC Davis Survival Guide

## ‚ÄºÔ∏è Overall Problem
Inefficient way of having to navigate through multiple websites in order to find information for UC Davis. 

## üí°Imagination / Vision
Students already have to navigate through college and the current layout of useful information is very dispersed. Our App and Website implement a simple and effective hub that contains all the useful information a students would want all in one place. Additionally, we also wanted to streamline finding a seat in the library so more time could be spent studying then looking for somewhere to sit down.

## üíªSolution
We created both an IOS app and website that allows for a convenient way to bring all the information a student would need on a daily basis as well as provides a simple and new user-friendly interface that's easy to navigate.
